# Twitter-Auto-Reply-AI-Agent-Prototype

Twitter Bot Prototypes

This project is a prototype system for generating intelligent and engaging replies to social media posts using OpenAI’s GPT models.
It is designed as an experiment for building an AI-powered reply engine that learns from past post–reply examples and adapts to new inputs.

Features

Few-shot learning with examples: Uses prior post–reply pairs as context to guide new responses.

Dynamic prompt construction: Builds a structured prompt with system + user messages.

Customizable randomness: Adjustable temperature parameter for creative vs. precise replies.

Interactive mode: Paste a new social media post and get a reply generated instantly.

Error handling: Catches API errors and outputs a fallback message.

How It Works

Setup OpenAI client:

from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key="your_api_key_here")


Provide example post–reply pairs (for context / few-shot learning):

previous_reply_pairs = [
    {"post": "Dudes reply 'banger' to your tweet then steal it.", "reply": "Because it’s a banger"},
    {"post": "JUST RECEIVED VERY BULLISH NEWS", "reply": "Drop the alpha lil bro"},
]


Generate a reply:

reply = generate_reply("Tweet: $BOSS @bossonbonk trading is now LIVE on #BitgetSpot. 🚀 Trade now: https://t.co/kqcZtl8svU https://t.co/xeHGEVKl1i", previous_reply_pairs)
print(reply)

Example Usage
$ python twitter_bot_prototypes.py
Paste the post you want to reply to:
Tweet: $BOSS @bossonbonk trading is now LIVE on #BitgetSpot. 🚀 Trade now: https://t.co/kqcZtl8svU

Generated Reply:
"Strap in, folks. We're going interstellar 🚀"

Dependencies

Python 3.8+

OpenAI Python SDK

Install via:

pip install openai

Limitations

Consistency of style: The model sometimes struggles to maintain a stable “voice.” Replies can vary widely between very good, mediocre, or off-tone, and full control of style was difficult to achieve.

Training accuracy: While the model successfully learned from provided examples and generated context-aware replies, it did not always match the exact style or quality I aimed for. Perfect fine-tuning on reply tone was not fully achieved.

Automation limits: Free-tier X (Twitter) API restrictions only allowed posting one reply every 15 minutes, limiting large-scale testing and real-time engagement.

Generative unpredictability: As with most LLM-based systems, outputs are inherently non-deterministic and can occasionally produce weak or irrelevant replies.

Notes

Prototype runs in interactive mode (input() in terminal).

Extendable for automation with Twitter APIs (not included here).

Replace the placeholder API key with your own before use.
